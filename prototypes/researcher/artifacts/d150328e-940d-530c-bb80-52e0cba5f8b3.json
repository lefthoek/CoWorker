What are the causes and consequences of that? In this dossier we explore how algorithmic colonialism operates today and what strategies we can use to resist its extractive tendencies. Lilian Stolk <a href=\"https://thehmm.nl/internet-in-the-rest-of-the-world/\"> asks people from different places around the world</a>, from Russia to Zimbabwe to China, to give us insights into the internet from their perspective.

Our digital public squares are now organised and determined by a handful of Big Tech companies. As a response, more and more initiatives towards an open and decentralised internet are emerging. In this dossier we explore whether alternative platforms can fix the internet. Lilian Stolk visits <a href=\"https://thehmm.nl/ohyay-ohyay-ohyay/\">the virtual office of Andrew Lin</a>, one of the founders of the community based platform ohyay.

TikTok is the app for making and sharing short videos.

In this dossier we&#x2019;re finding out how TikTok is re-writing the world. Josephine Oettle shares her research on the <a href=\"https://thehmm.nl/the-great-american-meme-off/\">role of TikTok</a> during the 2020 U.S. elections.
