Nearly a year later, solidarity remains a major cultural challenge, particularly in the field of media.</p><p>Europe needs a shared public space where a culture of solidarity can be practiced. It is there where the ongoing infodemic can be combated. Visit <a href=\"https://culturalfoundation.eu/activities/category/share\">SHARE</a> under our programmes to read more about the European Cultural Foundation&#x2019;s work on the development of a European public space.</p><p><strong>The deadline for submitting the expressions of interest was Wednesday 31 March 2021 at 13:00 CET and is now closed.</strong></p></div></div></div><div class=\"content-block title\" id><h2>What were we looking for?</h2></div><div class=\"content-block content\" id><div class=\"col col-1 pt-4 sm:pt-12\"><div><p>This call supports cross-border collaborative initiatives that reinforce a European Culture of Solidarity by contributing to open and democratic European digital and other media spaces. The Fund is open to individuals, collectives and organisations and supports initiatives that produce tangible results as well as have the potential of a sustainable impact and that fall into one or more of the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Cross-border media collaborations</strong> that address societal issues across Europe that have become more imminent as a direct or indirect consequence of the pandemic.</li><li><strong>Development of digital tools</strong> that are based on <strong>shared public values</strong> and that have the potential to contribute to a digital <strong>European public infrastructure</strong>.</li><li><strong>Storytelling for increased public attention and policy awareness</strong> regarding the needs and opportunities for open and democratic European digital and other media spaces.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"content-block content\" id><div class=\"col col-1 pt-4 sm:pt-12\"><div><p>The European Cultural Foundation has a large network of individuals and organisations that care about solidarity in Europe. Expressing your interest to apply for this call was <strong>an opportunity to become part of</strong> that family as we expand your and <strong>our international network</strong>.</p><p>Candidates selected in Phase I (March &#x2013; April 2021) to submit their project proposals in Phase II (April &#x2013; May<br> 2021) will also be connected to each other and to other relevant stakeholders of the foundation. Beyond the opportunity to expand networks, invited <strong>candidates will be offered a platform and resource to develop their idea further</strong> and improve their project proposal&#x2019;s relevance to the call.</p><p>In Phase II, shortlisted and invited candidates may apply for <strong>a grant up to a maximum of &#x20AC;40.000 per project</strong>. With a project term of up to 18 months, grants can be used for financing a wide range of activities ranging from seed money for entirely new initiatives to (co-)funding for scaling up already existing ideas to a European level.</p><p>Although co-funding is not a prerequisite for funding, a balanced budget with diversified resources can significantly improve the project&#x2019;s feasibility. Grants can cover production-, rental costs, online co-working and communication tools. They can also be used to cover expert fees, staff- and operational costs. However, it is highly recommended that these do not exceed 80% of the total requested budget unless justifiable.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"content-block content\" id><div class=\"col col-1 pt-4 sm:pt-12\"><div><p><strong>Phase I &#x2013; Expressing your interest: closed.</strong><br> At this stage, applicants were invited to submit their expressions of interest by completing a short form answering a few general questions on the applicant and on the project they would like to apply with. Although the call ultimately looks to support cross-border collaborations, in this first phase, we also welcomed submissions by local initiatives with European relevance that would like to use the platform offered via this call to establish partnerships and further develop the crossborder element of their project.</p><p><strong>Phase II &#x2013; Call for Proposals by invitation only</strong><br> After an internal assessment, up to 50 organisations will be shortlisted and invited to submit their project proposals. Guidelines and selection criteria will be announced in the invitation. The invited applicants are encouraged to further develop their project, to prepare a detailed budget and timeline and to develop partnerships across Europe. In support of this exercise, applicants will be brought into contact with one another and other relevant stakeholders in an online networking event.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"content-block title\" id><h2>Regional third round of Culture of Solidarity Fund</h2></div><div class=\"content-block content\" id><div class=\"col col-1 pt-4 sm:pt-12\"><div><p>In collaboration with<a href=\"https://www.fondazionecrt.it/\"> Fondazione CRT</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"https://www.fondazionecrc.it/#\">Fondazione CRC</a> we invited organisations from <strong>the Piedmont and Aosta Valley</strong> to apply to the <em>third round </em>of our Culture of Solidarity Fund.

Most of the European countries keep the tradition of crafting wine alive through the work of men, farmers, vineyard owners and oenologists. But climate crisis and the abrupt halt of out-of-home consumption due to the COVID19 crisis jeopardize the sector. By blending wines from the most representative vineyards of Europe we show the union of our traditional actors, share their know-how and promote their work and culture as proof of European solidarity.No marketing has been developed to make consumers discover through wine, the beauty of Europe, to embrace the &#x201C;Made in Europe&#x201D; label. According to the EU motto &#x201C;&#x2018;United in diversity&#x2019; and quoting Jos&#xE9; Ortega y Gasset&#x2018;s idea of &#x2018;Europe is a swarm: many bees and a single flight&#x2019;, OENOPE wants to promote &#x2018;Solidarity in diversity&#x2019;, assembling many wines for a single bottle.

Rehearsing The Revolution ensures an exciting pan-European dialogue between 3 countries [Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus] that are geographically, politically and historically connected, yet very different.Being European has many connotations around the continent and nearly all of these narratives are estranged from daily life, from the people. Every systemic change towards a new common narrative of pluriform notions starts in the imagination of people who envision the future they want. Rehearsing The Revolution works with the methodology of immersive collaborative storytelling and the artivism toolkit of Augusto Boal. His methods allow for a creative process that helps us to experience common ground with people you&#x2019;d never thought you could.The project partners will organise a series of residencies, workshops, presentations, and interviews with artists and the general public. In parallel to these physical events, their interactive digital platform rehearsingtherevolution.org will host all activities and generated materials like live streams, films, podcasts. &#x201C;In this case, perhaps the theatre is not revolutionary in itself, but it is surely a rehearsal for the revolution.&#x201D; (1974 Augusto Boal: Theatre of the Oppressed)</p> <a href=\"https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/cosround2-space\" class=\"icon-link mt-6\"><span>Read more.</span></a></div></div></div><div class=\"slide bg-gray-200\"><div class=\"flex-none md:flex\"><div class=\"w-full md:w-6/12 p-8 flex flex-col\"><p> The European legislative act from 2016 instated a list of 35 invasive plant species which are to be eradicated and banned from European soil. This means that these plants have been degraded to a minority that cannot be traded, imported, sold or grown within the borders of the European Union. Studio Wild wants to question this European legislation, provoking a discussion on whether spatial, legal and social restrictions contribute to a more inclusive society.Studio Wild&#x2019;s exhibition space at the Venice Biennale Architettura will host a garden of &#x2018;invasive alien plant species&#x2019;, which have been listed for their ethnic and biological characteristics and pose a threat to European native species. Their aim is to create a parallel between the fate of these species and the fate of many of our neighbors who struggle to find common ground in Europe just because they are different.Studio Wild will enclose a garden in a cave like space. A forbidden garden with a secretive or hidden atmosphere in which these forbidden plants can live in a salvaged environment.

The project encourages a wider circulation of socially engaged literature and wants to reinforce mutual understanding, and celebrate diversity for the benefit of all Europeans.Due to pandemic a vast number of literary festivals were cancelled - to the adversity of authors and publishers who rely on personal encounters. Yet literature and culture remain as important as ever.At the same time, there has been a renewed focus on the importance of people&#x2019;s creativity during lockdown. Arts and culture seemed vital for our social well being and our futures. Solid for Solidarity is a project that explicitly makes that argument and recognises the value and urgency of direct creative engagement. Tranzyt Foundation considers graphic novels a perfect &#x2014; and refreshingly engaging &#x2014; means to address the ongoing issues and strengthen social cohesion. Their project consists of two phases: A transnational, open to all, and free to enter competition for the best European graphic novel about solidarity and the importance of European values in these turbulent times, and Europe&#x2019;s future: The publication, promotion and distribution of print and ebook of the winner, and an anthology of runners up. To secure the diversity of voices and outreach of the call, the project will be promoted in partnership with the largest literary and comic culture festivals operating on the peripheries of mainstream cultural circulation in Europe.</p> <a href=\"https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/cosround2-tranzyt-foundation\" class=\"icon-link mt-6\"><span>Read more.</span></a></div></div></div><div class=\"slide bg-gray-200\"><div class=\"flex-none md:flex\"><div class=\"w-full md:w-6/12 p-8 flex flex-col\"><p> Social reading is the practice of commenting on literature through digital devices. Starting from Lombardy and Piedmont, two main European epicenters of the COVID19 outbreak, the &#x2018;Twitterature&#x2019; will engage European teachers and students to read together 10 passages of literature representing the essence of European identity on their self developed app Betwyll. This collective reading builds up on three previous projects (funded by Compagnia di San Paolo) that Associazione Culturale Twitteratura implemented in Italy from Spring 2018 onwards involving 200 classes of students from 14 regions. The students engaged through these projects were able to write more than 25,000 comments and were involved in dozens of events and school activities related to the texts they read. Interestingly enough, notwithstanding where and when the texts were set, their comments were also rich of suggestions and opinions about the present life as European citizens.This strengthens Twitteratura&#x2019;s belief that, in order to revive a European culture of solidarity between citizens from different nations, it is important to act at a deeper level, fostering the awareness of the core values defining the European identity as a whole and that literature and reading are perfect to enhance the awareness of solidarity as a form of respect and inclusion towards different cultures and identities.</p> <a href=\"https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/cosround2-tw-letteratura\" class=\"icon-link mt-6\"><span>Read more.</span></a></div></div></div><div class=\"slide bg-gray-200\"><div class=\"flex-none md:flex\"><div class=\"w-full md:w-6/12 p-8 flex flex-col\"><p> Unhack Democracy is a pro-democracy and election watchdog group that facilitates the project &#x201C;Election Health Check&#x201D;.
