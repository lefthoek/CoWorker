Google\ndoes it. Google&apos;s approach is to take an unsolvable problem and pump a\nmotherload of resources into it. Most others only copy the unsolvable problem\nbit.  True to it&apos;s cutting corner mindset, Lefthoek leaves shooting at moons\nto Google and its copy-cats and picks low-hanging fruit instead.\n</div></td>\n  </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&apos;s a tidal wave of mysticism<br>\nSurging through our jet-aged generation<br>\nIt&apos;s all designed to take us to the sky</p>\n<p><em>Funkadelic</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 2010, Google&apos;s Larry Page and Sergey Brin asked their buddy\n<a href=\"https://hanna-barbera.fandom.com/wiki/Astro\">Astro</a> Teller to front an\nexperimental company builder mysteriously called <a href=\"https://x.company/\">X</a>. The\nsingle roman numeral signifies the almost religious belief in exponential logic\nthat both X and its mother company hold. X promises to only invest in ideas that\ncould make at least a 10x &#x2014; Xx, get it?  &#x2014; impact over the status\nquo.</p>\n<p>The projects that X engages with are appropriately named\n<a href=\"https://www.thegeniusworks.com/2020/02/a-decade-of-moonshots-alphabet-x/\">moonshots</a>.\nA term first introduced in Jules Verne&apos;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon\">From the Earth to the\nMoon</a> but popularized\nby president John F. Kennedy in 1961. In his famous speech, Kennedy promised\ncongress that he would get a man on the moon before the end of the decade.\nMoreover, and equally important, the president also pledged to bring this man\nback safely to earth.  Eight years and $25.4 billion dollars &#x2014; that would\nequate to $150 billion in today&apos;s economy &#x2014; later, Apollo 11 managed to\nfulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>X takes this idea one step further by refering to itself as a moonshot factory.\nThe company doesn&apos;t just embark on nearly impossible missions, but aims to make\nthese journeys mass-producible. Its mission does not consist of solving one\n<em>particular</em> impossible problem, but finding the recipe to solve <em>any</em>\nimpossible problem. X&apos;s blueprint for producing moonshots consists of three\nsimple, repeatable steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on an unsolvable problem</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spend a shitload of money on it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sell the resulting solution</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over a decade later, we can indisputably conclude that X&apos;s moonshot recipe has\nlead to a massive amount of inspiring Wired covers. Whereas world&apos;s biggest\nproblems seem to be as unsolvable as 10 years ago. But hey, those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/google-glass-advice-smartglasses-glasshole#:~:text=Early%20adopters%20of%20Glass%2C%20derogatorily,for%20long%20periods%20of%20time.\">Google\nGlasses</a>\ndo make you look cool while cruising your <a href=\"https://waymo.com/\">Waymo</a>, right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/landing/images/moonshot.jpg\"><img src=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/raw/landing/images/moonshot.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Mariah Leynes @ Unsplash\"></a></p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-counterfeit-moon-shooters\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/landing/sites/landing/data/posts/the-low-end-theory.mdx#counterfeit-moon-shooters\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><path/></svg></a>Counterfeit Moon Shooters</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rake in dividends<br>\nLet the money stack<br>\nSee you copycats</p>\n<p><em>Brockhampton</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More impressive than the actual solutions that it has produced, may be the\namount of <a href=\"https://www.moonshot-factory.eu/en/missions/\">copy cats</a> that X has\ninspired since then. Over the last decade, many an agency, incubator, or VC firm\nhas reinvented itself as a moonshot factory.</p>\n<p>While the marketing material of these counterfeit moon shooters was mostly\ncopied one-to-one from X&apos;s website, closer inspection reveals that they did in\nfact made some small but significant changes to the original formula. In true\n<a href=\"https://nostarch.com/hardwarehackerpaperback\">Shenzen fashion</a>, they added a few features and removed some others.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Focus an fashionable problem</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask for a outrageous amount of money</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we speak, the tech world is overflowing with aspiring moon shooters searching\nfor generous sponsors and benevolent donors. Entrepreneurs no longer look for\ninvestors to fund their solutions. Instead, they look for those that will let\nthem solve the world biggest problems. Give these aspiring Elon Musks enough\nmoney and they will cure cancer, stop famine, and end poverty. Or so they claim.\nHumanity and humility share little more than a few common letters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/landing/images/moonshot-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/raw/landing/images/moonshot-2.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by NASA @ Unsplash\"></a></p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-flying-low\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/landing/sites/landing/data/posts/the-low-end-theory.mdx#flying-low\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><path/></svg></a>Flying Low</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So low-key that you probably missed it<br>\nAnd yet it&apos;s so loud<br>\nThat it stands in the crowd</p>\n<p><em>A Tribe Called Quest</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lefthoek consciously chooses not to aim for the moon. We leave ego and glory\nfor others, and are perfectly satisfied to do the things that need to be done\nand no one else seems to care about.

In\neveryday tasks, there are so many small problems that could make your work a\nmore fun and satisfying. These could be things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Onboarding a new staff member that feels lost at the new job</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storing and retrieving all the interesting links that your team members shared</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Summarize all the messages that you missed during your vacation</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lefhoek is dedicated to solving all of these issues and many more, one at a\ntime: by as few means possible. That, in short, is what <em>the low end theory</em> is\nall about.</p>\n</article></div></div>",
