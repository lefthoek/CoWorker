Crowdfunding is one of the most widely used ways to raise capital, especially at an early startup stage. It primarily falls into several types: equity crowdfunding like, <a href=\"https://www.seedinvest.com/\">SeedInvest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.seedrs.com/\">Seedrs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.symbid.com/\">Symbid</a>; rewards-based&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\">Indiegogo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter;</a>&#xA0;and donation-based&#xA0;<a href=\"https://nl.gofundme.com/\">GoFundMe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/\">JustGiving</a> etc.&#xA0;Equity crowdfunding in particular has been in the news recently, with large European platforms Crowdcrube and Seedrs announcing their <a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/10/crowdcube-and-seedrs-plan-to-merge-to-create-one-of-the-worlds-largest-private-equity-marketplaces/\">merger</a> in October in 2020, only to put the brakes on<a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2021/03/equity-crowdfunding-platforms-crowdcube-seedrs-officially-terminate-merger/\"> a few days ago</a>.</p>\n<p>Crowdfunding is undoubtedly a powerful tool to raise money for early stage startups, but is a fruit of hard work, pure luck, or an extensive network?. We decided to have a chat with startups that recently secured funding via crowdfunding to learn first-hand about the areas to pay attention to and some practical tips. Let&#x2019;s dive in!</p>\n<p><strong>Why crowdfunding?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the principal benefits of crowdfunding vs. traditional funding options (venture capital, business angels etc.) is the opportunity of getting feedback and support from many people.&#xA0;<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126023\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Simon-Rabin-150x150.png\" alt width=\"77\" srcset=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Simon-Rabin-150x152.png 150w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Simon-Rabin-297x300.png 297w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Simon-Rabin-356x361.png 356w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Simon-Rabin.png 357w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 77px) 100vw, 77px\"><em>&#x201C;I think the most powerful way for a business to grow is to have thousands of investors advocating something they believe in&#x201D;,</em> says Simon Rabin, CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/12/democratization-is-key-to-why-fintech-has-been-so-disruptive-interview-with-chips-ceo-and-founder-simon-rabin/\">Chip</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126024\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-150x150.jpeg\" alt width=\"81\" srcset=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-696x696.jpeg 696w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus.jpeg 1068w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-420x420.jpeg 420w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-Stroev-Nebeus-500x500.jpeg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 81px) 100vw, 81px\">Michael Stroev, <a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/12/london-and-barcelona-based-fintech-startup-nebeus-raised-e995k-via-an-equity-crowdfunding-campaign-on-seedrs/\">Nebeus</a> agrees: &#x201C;<em>Crowdfunding gives you two things that are crucial in the life of a startup: Exposure and a validation of your business.

This was best as we&#x2019;d already built our own customer base, the business was easier to understand, and we could offer rewards</em>!&#x201D; explains Annabel Thomas, CEO at <a href=\"https://ncnean.com/\">NC&#x2019;nean Distillary</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126020\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Amit-Jaura-150x150.jpg\" alt width=\"80\" srcset=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Amit-Jaura-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Amit-Jaura-265x261.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\">&#x201C;<em>The great thing about crowdfunding is that it can be applied throughout (nearly) any stage of a startup.

Some accept early-stage startups, while others require the startup to be at a more advanced stage.

All of the founders we spoke to highlighted that marketing is one of, if not the, central element of your campaign that will dictate it&#x2019;s success. it&#x2019;s not the case that you upload a campaign and hope that people will visit the page &#x2013; there should be a clearly defined and military-precision marketing plan behind it. &#x201C;<em>Crowdfunding is more than 50% a marketing exercise!</em>&#x201D; confirms Annabel Thomas, NC&#x2019;nean Distillery.</p>\n<p><em><strong><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126074\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jessica-Kelly-thr3efold-150x150.jpg\" alt width=\"80\" srcset=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jessica-Kelly-thr3efold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jessica-Kelly-thr3efold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jessica-Kelly-thr3efold.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\"></strong>&#x201C;So important!&#x201D;</em> says&#xA0;Jessica Kelly Founder &amp; CEO of Thr3efold. Jessica goes on to highlight that crowdfunding should be treated with the importance of the launch of a new product &#x2013; creating buzz across multiple channels:&#xA0;&#x201C;<em>Marketing is the fuel for your sales efforts. No one will buy if they don&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;s for sale. Any launch we do as a company has a rollout plan that includes teasing out news and building buzz and education on social, blog, and email. Each channel gets told in a slightly different way that works for them&#x201D;.</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126021\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hannah-kromminga-150x150.png\" alt width=\"80\" srcset=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hannah-kromminga-150x150.png 150w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hannah-kromminga-300x300.png 300w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hannah-kromminga-324x327.png 324w, https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hannah-kromminga.png 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\">Any successful crowdfunding campaign also of course requires time and preparation, and marketing is a big part of that.&#xA0;Hannah Kromminga, Founder of GIFTD, explains: &#x201C;<em>You need at least four months, better six months of preparation. Your audience needs to be ready to buy your product on the day you launch to achieve enough traction during the first days.

Robbin Hoogstraten, Symbid advises: &#x201C;<em>Never rely your campaign only on the platform&#x2019;s network; you will need to reach out to new potential investors using all the communication channels you can use: social media, partners, traditional media, networking events, speaking at events</em>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>A &#x2018;crowning jewel&#x2019; piece of&#xA0;crowdfunding&#xA0;advice </strong></p>\n<p>We asked the founders for the best piece of advice they can give to those who plan to start a crowdfunding campaign.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-126022\" src=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Annabel-Thomas-150x150.jpg\" alt width=\"80\">&#x201C;<em>My advice would be to do&#xA0;crowdfunding for the right reasons. It is not a quick-fix fundraising route, and in many ways, it&#x2019;s harder than raising money through angels in terms of time and money required.

You need an extensive reach to be able to successfully fund a crowdfunding campaign. Additionally, </em><em>choose the platform which matches your business.
