It&apos;s an evolving change plan that you use to drive customer centric innovation.</p><p>So now that we have our basic journey map set up let&apos;s look at some of the more advanced features. These are features that will make your life a lot easier when you use your journey map on a day to day basis.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Using the journey map means updating the map. You&apos;ll want to add and remove details in the map.</p><p>This is where you see a clear distinction between different journey mapping tools. Some tools are great at visualizing the map but break apart when you need to change things.</p><p>Let&apos;s see how easy this is using Google sheets.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Changing the order of lanes is as simple as dragging and dropping them. The only thing you need to be mindful of is when you have selected lanes that contain merged cells.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10095\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragging_lanes1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Drag rows or columns to update your journey map</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Adding new lanes is also really straight forward.

The way to do that is by inserting a new row. Just right click in the place where you want to insert it and select add.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10101\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adding_new_rows1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Add a row to make room for new cards</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Keep in mind that when you insert a new row you will get a empty cell in all your lanes.

It&apos;s not hard. Especially if you learn to use the keyboard shortcuts.&#xA0;</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>This is one of the most overlooked features by people who are just starting out with customer journey mapping. But it&apos;s one of the most important features a professional needs.</p><p>It&apos;s the ability to quickly see in the map what we&apos;re working on. And who is doing what. As we said before the journey map is a change plan not a static image.</p><p>There are a few ways you can track status in your map using Google sheets.</p><p>A simple way is to change the background color of a card to indicate a status. Green cards could be new things that you&apos;re implementing and red cards could be things that need to be removed from the journey.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10109\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/status_background1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Use a background color to indicate a status</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>The other way you can indicate a status is by using cell borders.

You do that by going using the <strong>Insert &gt; Comment</strong> option.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10114\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adding_comments1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Add context to cards by using comments</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>This brings us to the next important feature a professional wants in their journey mapping too.</p></div></div>\n</div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_contentbox_shortcode thrv-content-box tve-elem-default-pad\"> <div class=\"tve-cb\"><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>When you work on your journey map with a team (which you always should) a critical feature that you from your tool is to see what how your map has changed.</p><p>You want to see the progress you&apos;ve made over the last 4 weeks and ideally who has contributed what. Google sheets has this feature very well implemented.</p><p>To see how your map has evolved just go to <strong>File &gt; Version History &gt; See version history</strong>.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10117\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/version_history1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Keep track of how your journey map has evolved using the version history feature</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Using this option you can also create named versions of your map. Which can be really useful to indicate major milestones. For instance when you have added a lane for a new department to the map.</p><p>The cool thing about Google sheets is that you can see the changes on a per cell basis. Crazy!</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10120\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cell_history1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Track changes to a specific card using cell history</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Journey mapping is a collaborative process.

You do that by via the <strong>Sharing</strong> option and make them an editor.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10123\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sharing1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Share the journey map inside and outside your team</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>You can also give read only access to someone. This is useful when you want to spread the map in the organisation to gather feedback but don&apos;t want people to mess around with it.</p><h4 class>Linking to cells</h4><p>Another very useful collaboration feature is that you can get a <strong>unique link to any cell</strong> in the journey map.</p><p>Imagine that you want to get input from the HR department. Rather than just sending them the map and hoping they will find the right place to look, you can send them a link which opens the map directly on the HR lane for instance.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10126\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/link_to_cell1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Get a unique link to any card in the journey map</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>It&apos;s small features like this that make your day to day work so much easier.</p><h4 class>Adding safe gaurds</h4><p>You know those inflatable tubes they add to your bowling lane to as a safe gaurd that all your balls end up in the gutter? Well Google sheets has something similar. And it&apos;s feature that you&apos;ll appreciate.</p><p>You can protect certain parts of your map from being edited by other people. You do that by selecting a group of cells and opening up <strong>Data &gt; Protect Sheets and Ranges.</strong></p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10129\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/protect_cells1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Prevent people from editing specific parts of the journey map by protecting ranges</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Why is this useful? Imagine again that you want to get input from the HR department on the journey. You send them the correct link to the map as described above. And next to that you tell them that the map is setup in a way that they can only change the HR related things.</p><p>Sometimes people are reluctant to contibute to a journey map as they don&apos;t want to mess things up. Telling them that you&apos;ve put safe gaurds in place will give them more confidence to contribute.</p><h4 class>Tagging people</h4><p>The final collaboration feature which you need to know about is the ability to tag people.</p><p>When you use the @ sign in the comment feature it will provide you with a list of people you can then tag in the comment. What&apos;s great about this is that the person you&apos;ve tagged will get a notification through email that they have been tagged.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-10132\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tagging_people1.gif\"></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Tag people in the comments and send them a notification</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>This is extremely useful as it allows you to keep the discussion tied to the relevant parts of the journey. Rather than going back and forward via email or slack without any context.</p><p>Again this is one of those small things that just makes your life as a professional so much easier.</p></div></div>\n</div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_contentbox_shortcode thrv-content-box tve-elem-default-pad\"> <div class=\"tve-cb\"><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\">\t<p>Imagine that you need to show the journey map to your boss tomorrow. So you want to export the map as a PDF document and send that over. Or in a world where we have physical meetings again you could print that PDF and present a tangible version of your journey map.</p><p>Google sheets makes this really easy.

Now it&apos;s time to answer the big question.</p><p>Is Google sheets or Excel a viable customer journey mapping tool?</p></div></div>\n</div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_contentbox_shortcode thrv-content-box tve-elem-default-pad\"> <div class=\"tve-cb\"><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element\"><p>If you&apos;ve been following along you will have seen that Google sheets has a lot of potential as a journey mapping tool. But it also has some drawbacks which you should take into consideration.</p><h4 class>No guiding structure</h4><p>A spreadsheet are basically a blank canvas. You can do anything with them. This also means that it&apos;s up to you to come up with the structure of your journey map. If you&apos;ve never create a journey map before this process can be a bit daunting. You can always start with a <a href=\"https://www.servicedesignshow.com/customer-journey/templates-and-examples/\">journey map template</a> and modify that so it fits your needs.</p><h4 class>Risk of losing empathy</h4><p>Journey maps should <strong>tell a story</strong> (link naar what is a CJM). A disadvantage of using Google sheets is that it&apos;s not designed to tell stories by default. So it&apos;s very tempting to create a very left brain and rational journey map. Before you know it your journey map has become a process map that communicates zero empathy.</p><p>You&apos;ve seen how to add a visual layer to your journey map. It&apos;s definitely doable. You just have to be a bit more mindful about it compared to some of the other journey mapping tools.</p><h4 class>Harder maintain a consistent visual style</h4><p>This is especially true as soon as you start messing around with things like background colors and borders. You&apos;ll find yourself fiddling around with the visual aspects of your journey map quite often. And let&apos;s be honest this is not where you want to invest your time in.</p><h4 class>No integration with other templates</h4><p>Some journey mapping tools allow you to create personas, stakeholder maps and other artefacts related to the service design process. Google sheets will never have that feature as it&apos;s a generic tool. Of course there&apos;s nothing stopping you from creating something like an empathy map in a spreadsheet. But be careful that Google sheets doesn&apos;t become your hammer and everything else a nail.</p><h4 class>Potential licensing issues</h4><p>When you introduce a new tool in an organisation licensing is always an issue. Your company might have a strict policy that doesn&apos;t allow the use of Google or Microsoft products. When you&apos;re still flying under the radar you might get away with it but when you need to start collaborating on the journey map across the organisation it becomes a problem.</p><h4 class>Doesn&apos;t have a professional feel</h4><p>Think about it. Every professional has its own set of specialized and dedicated tools. This goes for your car mechanic but also for your colleagues working at the finance department. So why shouldn&apos;t you as a CX professional have your own tools as well? Using Google sheets to create journey maps might be seen in the organisation as the finance department using a calculator to do create the yearly forecasts.</p><h3 id=\"t-1608211952572\" class>Why would I want to use Google sheets or Excel</h3><p>After reading the drawbacks you might wonder why would anyone want to use Google sheets or Excel to create their journey maps, the answer is simple.</p><p>Almost everyone already has access to these tools.</p><p>The learning curve is relatively low as people are already familiar with the tool.</p><p>And Google sheets just doesn&apos;t feel as scary to managers.</p><p>Sometimes the best tool (to start with) is the one that you have at your disposal.</p><h3 id=\"t-1608211952573\" class>When should I use Google sheets or Excel</h3><p>The way I see it there are basically 3 scenarios and only in one of them would I recommend Google sheets as your go to journey mapping tool. This is based on the assumption that you don&apos;t already have any other journey mapping tool in place.</p><h4 class>Scenario 1: The workshop - use a quick and dirty tool</h4><p>When you need a customer journey map for a workshop or just want to capture the results. And you don&apos;t plan to do anything with the map after the workshop then just use a quick and dirty tool. I would pick up a set of sharpies and brown paper or when it needs to be digital a tool like Miro.</p><h4 class>Scenario 2: The project - use Google sheets</h4><p>If you&apos;re in a project that runs for a few weeks and requires a journey map, Google sheets might be the tool you want to reach for. You don&apos;t have to spend a lot of time teaching your team mates how to use the tool.</p><p>You (hopefully) don&apos;t have to go through a complicated licensing process. Google sheets allows you to get up and running fast and focus most of the scares time you have in a project on the content.</p><h4 class>Scenario 3: The strategy - use a professional tool</h4><p>As soon as you start seeing customer journey maps as something that will help you to drive customer centric innovation within your organisation it&apos;s time to reach for a professional tool.</p><p>A professional tool will help you to start treating journey maps as a capital that builds up over time. The small details and nuances in professional tools allow you to work more efficiently and when you use journey maps on a day to day basis that quickly starts to add up.</p><p>Just as you don&apos;t want your don&apos;t want your journey maps to run on a spreadsheet just like you wouldn&apos;t want that for your enterprise billing system.</p></div></div>\n</div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_contentbox_shortcode thrv-content-box tve-elem-default-pad\"> <div class=\"tve-cb\"><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element tve-froala fr-box\"><p>You can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hs2cyPgQbn0SyRDK5vDKLS1n2x6e_3eKimJ3KtSWGRE/copy\" class=\"tve-froala fr-basic\"><strong>get access to the journey map</strong></a> we&apos;ve created in this article.</p><p>Just make a copy of it and start playing around.</p></div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption\"><span class=\"tve_image_frame\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hs2cyPgQbn0SyRDK5vDKLS1n2x6e_3eKimJ3KtSWGRE/copy\"><img class=\"tve_image wp-image-9921\" alt width=\"640\" src=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2.jpg 2032w, https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2-300x176.jpg 300w, https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2-768x451.jpg 768w, https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2-1536x901.jpg 1536w, https://servicedesignshow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot2-1440x845.jpg 1440w\"></a></span><p class=\"wp-caption-text thrv-inline-text\">Make a copy of the customer journey map</p></div></div>\n</div><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_contentbox_shortcode thrv-content-box tve-elem-default-pad\"> <div class=\"tve-cb\"><div class=\"thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element tve-froala fr-box\"><p>The focus of this article was to show you how to use the tools.</p><p>The next obvious step is really to create your own journey map.</p><p>You might run into questions like: which journey should I map first, where should my journey end and how detailed should my journey map be?</p><p>If that&apos;s the case, have a look at <a href=\"https://www.servicedesignshow.com/courses/the-perfect-map/\" class=\"tve-froala\">The Perfect Map</a>.</p><p>It will guide you step-by-step through the entire process of creating a useful journey map.</p></div></div>\n</div></div>",
