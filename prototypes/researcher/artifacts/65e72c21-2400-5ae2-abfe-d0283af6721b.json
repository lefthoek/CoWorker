Governments don&apos;t trust their citizens to stay inside, while citizens\ndon&apos;t believe that their governments are acting in their best interest.\nStrangers are vessels for deadly viruses, and viruses are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/health/fearing-terrorism-us-asks-journals-to-censor-articles-on-virus.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=grady,%20fauci&amp;st=cse\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">dangerous\nweapons</a>\ndeveloped by foreign governments or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clones_of_Dr._Funkenstein\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Dr.\nFrankensteins</a>. In\nfact, the contemporary global political landscape closely resembles a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Mexican\nStandoff</a>.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">Meanwhile on the internet, things are not looking very bright either. Consumers\nare constantly forced to accept a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/315846903/Dr-Faust-s-Internet-Dilemma\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Faustian\ntradeoff</a>:\neither hand over your personal data or give up your social life. Finding a\ntrustworthy source of information has become next to impossible. Knowledge is\nconsidered an entertaining conversation starter, but does not hold any weight as\nsuch. One man&apos;s facts is another&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/jared-kushner-coronavirus-fake-news\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">fake\nnews</a>.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">Amidst all these suspicious minds, however, I am optimistic that we can <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/beyonce-and-jay-z-everything-is-love-guide.html\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">rebuild\ntrust\nrelations</a>\nin the public realm: both online and offline. <a href=\"https://github.com/OffCourse/public-badges\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Public\nBadges</a> are a modest attempt to\nprovide building blocks that enable organizations and initiatives to\ncommunicate their values with their users. To build trust relations build on\nevidence, not just anecdotes.</p><h2 class=\"css-1tkprnr\">The Paradox of Security</h2><blockquote class=\"css-11xyczo\"><p class=\"css-9379yh\">Why can&apos;t you see\nWhat you&apos;re doing to me<p>\nWhen you don&apos;t believe a word I say? </p></p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">&#x2014; Elvis Presley</p></blockquote><p class=\"css-9379yh\">As my teacher Friedrich Kittler posed,\n<a href=\"https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262062749.001.0001/upso-9780262062749-chapter-6\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Code</a>\nwas originally developed to establish secure communication against a backdrop of\nsuspicion. Its invention dates back to the Roman Empire. Foot soldiers were\nordered to carry encrypted messages &#x2014; that they could not decypher\nthemselves &#x2014; between higher officers that were entrusted with secret\nkey. They thereby actively performed the paradox that holds the internet hostage\ntoday: a secure network of communication comes at the expense of trust.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">Looking back at the <a href=\"https://immerse.news/25-years-of-internet-its-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-24d46ccfc475\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">history of the\ninternet</a>,\nit is easy to see that we invested a lot in making our technology secure, but\nnot nearly as much in making it trustworthy. Security measures alone, however,\nnever made our digital spaces any less dangerous. Most attempts to create safe\ndigital public spaces based on security alone failed or even backfired. At the\nsame time, the actual solution was often found by looking in exactly the\nopposite direction: building <a href=\"https://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/Cheerleading_Pyramids\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">networks of\ntrust</a>.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">In order to illustrate this, I&apos;ll walk you through a relatively recent example:\nthe <a href=\"https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/a-brief-history-of-spam-filtering-and-deliverability-gunter-haselberger/\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">history of spam\nfiltering</a>.\nUp until the mid 1990&apos;s, little to nothing was done to prevent the unwanted\nsoliciting on the internet. However, the rising importance of digital\ncommunication combined with the overwhelming increase of unwanted emails created\na demand for spam filters. The first attempts all revolved around blocking\nsuspicious domain and filtering for unwanted emails. These measure, however,\nweren&apos;t very effective. Spammers soon discovered techniques like domain and\nidentity spoofing that made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between\nemail and\n<a href=\"https://www.frolichawaii.com/stories/okinawas-potama-spam-musubi-sandwiches-are-coming-waikiki\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">spam</a>.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">The big breakthrough came during the mid 2000&apos;s when ISP&apos;s shifted to so-called\nreputation lists, something that was complemented with engagement metrics over\nthe last decade. Instead of just building blacklists, ISP&apos;s started sharing\ntheir whitelist and other positive metrics with another. Turns out, it&apos;s much\nmore effective to build networks of trusted partners than to police the\noffenders. (The history of anti-virus software by the way is remarkably\nsimilar.)</p><h2 class=\"css-1tkprnr\">Invest in Trust</h2><blockquote class=\"css-11xyczo\"><p class=\"css-9379yh\">And we can&apos;t build our dreams<br>\nOn suspicious minds </p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">&#x2014; Elvis Presley</p></blockquote><p class=\"css-9379yh\">In order to make the internet more safe, we have to invest in building networks\nof trust. In order to achieve this, technology alone can never be the answer. As\nthe history of spam filtering shows, coalitions of actual people and\norganizations are an excellent medicine against the side-effects of algorithms.\nBut technology can be part of the solution. And technology needs to be. Because\neven more dangerous than letting trust be a purely algorithmic consideration, is\nleaving it entirely anecdotal. <a href=\"https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/989101/10-ways-to-tell-if-he-is-a-good-guy/\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">&quot;I know him, he&apos;s a good\nguy&quot;</a>,\nis a statement that was invalidated for once and for all by: <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">&quot;Don&apos;t be\nevil.&quot;</a></p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">The safety of our <a href=\"https://publicspaces.net\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Public Spaces</a> needs to be evidence\nbased. With <a href=\"https://github.com/OffCourse/public-badges\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Public Badges</a>, we\nenable organizations to collect and communicate the evidence around the values\nthat they consider valuable. In future posts, I&apos;ll write more about the exact\nmechanisms that we are developing to facilitate these processes. For now,\nhowever, I want to conclude by saying this:\nsustainable safety cannot be built upon security. Let&apos;s invest in trust instead.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\"><a href=\"https://github.com/OffCourse/public-badges\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Public Badges</a> is an initiative of\n<a href=\"https://publicspaces.net\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Public Spaces</a> that is currently being developed by\n<a href=\"https://waag.org\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Waag</a> and <a href=\"https://offcourse-studio.com\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Offcourse Studio_</a>.</p><p class=\"css-9379yh\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brittaniburns?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" class=\"css-rnuluq\">Brittani Burns</a> on Unsplash</p></div>",
