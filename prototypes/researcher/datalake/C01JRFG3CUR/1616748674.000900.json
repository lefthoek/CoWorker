Labels help us navigate the\n  different contexts active in our modern society. Moreover, these labels are\n  now more so propagated on the worldwide web as a tool to brand ourselves with\n  or amongst others, in the diverse online communities. Consequently, this how\n  the ideals of digital citizenship were born. Have a read and see wich persona\n  you identify with the most!\n---\n\nAs we gear-up for the incoming 4th Industrial Revolution, a large part of our\nsociety have take on key roles as we more into a more tech-driven era. Whether\ndirectly or indirectly, you are a participant in this monumental shift in\nsociety. Here at Lefthoek we try understand our society through 5 different\npersonas. Taking into consideration both the past and present experiences that\nhas led us all to this forthcoming era, we believe we all had a part to play.\n*The question is, what digital citizen do you identify yourself as?* Your label\nis fluid and can evolve with the changing times, but  which persona you relate\nthe most with currently ?\n\n***Dreamers*** are individuals who I think have always been present in society.\nThese individuals learn about life quickly and eventually find the current state\nof affairs mundane. They tend to grow big dreams in mind and aim to obtain the\nfruit at the top of the tree. This metaphor is telling to their aims and goals\nbut also foreboding the high risk they are willing to take. The fruits at the\ntop of the tree are hard to obtain and they are not always ripe. Visionaries are\nwilling to risk it all to realise their dreams. One prime example of a visionary\ntoday is Elon Musk. Musk is determined to take humans to wifi0-working Mars in\nthe next few years. Will this dream materialise, we shall only wait and see... \n\n![Telescopes](/images/telescopes.jpg)\n\n***Laika*** was one the first animals that were sent to explore space. Retrieved\nas a stray dog from the streets of Moscow, she became the first dog to explore\nspace under the notable Soviet space envoy Sputnik 2 in 1957.  [This notion is\nstill practiced\ntoday](<https://www.businessinsider.nl/animals-nasa-russia-space-agencies-sent-to-space-2019-6?international=true&amp;r=US#:~:text=Countries%20including%20the%20US%2C%20the,send%20animals%20into%20orbit%20today.>)\nbut might sound incredulous to some and many may even be inclined to call on\nPETA. Nevertheless, this was an insightful feat to the information that was\ngathered during the Space race era. During the Cold War, the space race pushed\nvisionaries/dreamers and fellow politicians to align their ideals to achieve\nhuge leaps in terms of space exploration. This collaboration then brought about\nnew key players, such as Laika, that provided society with much insight with the\ntrajectory they were heading with. Laikas are not intentional players, they are\nrandom intermediaries that factually illustrate the possibilities and the\nlimitations society, through trial and error. Laikas were the one's who take the\ndriver's seat. They are and continue to be the failed encounters that teach us\nsomething valuable about our dreams. They provide insights and lesson's learnt.\n\n***Moonshooters*** can be characterized as the over-ambitious cousins of\nvisionaries, armed with awareness, time and money. This title was [\"first\nintroduced in Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon but popularized by\npresident John F. Kennedy in\n1961.](<https://www.lefthoek.com/blog/the-low-end-theory/>)\" Moonshooters are\npassionate about solving the world's current wicked problems but fail to\nunderstand that the input of other disciplines and expertise is necessary. Also\nit is important to note that not all the of the problems in the 21st century can\nbe solved through technology. Like the name suggests, \"moonshot\" conveys an idea\nor ideal that is a 'long-shot'. It is something that has a high probability to\nnot work and this is stemmed from the fact that moonshot projects are done\nwithout any prior, concrete research of potential risks and benefits. The\nmoonshooter label falls on those those who are doers rather than thinkers and\nact fast. Much like the visionaries that dream big, they take it step further\nand try to realise the actual project as soon as possible. They are the big\nrisk-takers, willing to act then later find out the barriers or issues that are\npresent. \n\n***Passengers*** are individuals that go with the flow. Have you heard of the\nsaying that \"dead fish go with the flow\"? This harsh reference contextualises\nthe notion of effort. Passengers in the tech can viewed as myriad of individuals\nthat are not necessarily involved in the disruption of the industry. They are\npart of the audience. It is important to note that Passengers still retain much\nresponsibility and agency in this journey. Passengers can change trains, get off\nand also change modes of transport i.e. this means that they also can choose\nwhich apps are much useful to the society and which technologies should be\nembraced and given room evolve. They are can also be seen as cheerleaders as\nthey provide insight on which technologies are interesting.\n\n![Photo by Arūnas Naujokas on Unsplash](/images/apple-trees.jpg)\n\nAs the name suggests, this persona is quite self explanatory. ***Spectators***\nare similar to passengers but relinquish their agency of choice and intuition to\nthe powers that may be. They are curious and are willing to take a risk by being\npassively involved. They go with the flow. Spectators can bee seen as observers\nor members of the audience, just like passengers. This means that they can still\nhave an opinion on the matter but their vested interest is not as strong. \n\n***Fruit-pickers*** are in-between the dreamers and moonshooters. They are\naction-driven much like the moonshooters but they strive for simpler and more\nefficient solutions with the resources that are within reach. If you think of a\nfruit tree, it is much easier to take the ripe fruit that is on a lower branch\nthan it is getting the fruit at the top of the tree. Problems should be handled\nin this manner, but you find, particularly in the tech industry, innovations to\npick the fruit at the top of the tree tend to materalise much more often than\nsimple solutions aimed to get the fruit at the top of the tree.\n\nRead more on fruit-pickers in our previous article\n[here.](./blog/the-low-end-theory/)\n\n\n```","title":"sites/landing/data/posts/moonshooters-fruitpickers-and-laikas.mdx","footer":"<https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek|lefthoek/lefthoek>","id":1,"title_link":"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/blog/sites/landing/data/posts/moonshooters-fruitpickers-and-laikas.mdx","footer_icon":"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico","color":"24292f","mrkdwn_in":["text"],"bot_id":"B01QBHR5U1W","app_unfurl_url":"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/blog/sites/landing/data/posts/moonshooters-fruitpickers-and-laikas.mdx","is_app_unfurl":true}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"j6t","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/lefthoek/lefthoek/blob/blog/sites/landing/data/posts/moonshooters-fruitpickers-and-laikas.mdx"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"83a2f433-0e24-461b-b23d-013c6c4c38ed","type":"message","text":"<@U01JK3M0Z36> this is the link to the file on git:","user":"U01JK1RUG3E","ts":"1616527856.018200","team":"T01K2MPN0JU","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"PX1Q","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"U01JK3M0Z36"},{"type":"text","text":" this is the link to the file on git:"}]}]}],"reactions":[{"name":"+1::skin-tone-4","users":["U01JK3M0Z36"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"fcb64cc2-7c0c-441b-8b76-e107515769a8","type":"message","text":"Love Laika! :wink:","user":"U01L86TCZE1","ts":"1616526890.017800","team":"T01K2MPN0JU","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"1krP","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Love Laika!
