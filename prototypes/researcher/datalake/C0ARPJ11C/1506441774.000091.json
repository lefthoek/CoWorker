I feel lucky to be welcomed as a new team member here. I like to introduce myself to you. \n\nSo.\n\nHi. Nice to meet you all.\n\nIf you are in a hurry. Read no further. \n\nJust say hi back if you feel like it \n\n:wink:\n\n\nIf you love reading and have loads of time and want to read my not so brief introduction then go on reading.\n\nBe my guest.\n\nThe long and the short of it.\n\nBrief writing is not my core competence (yet).\n\nI really like to learn this along the way.\n\n\nToday it's 98 days ago that I 'met' Jan Hein via Twitter.\n\n<https://twitter.com/yeehaa/status/876571506821791744>\n\nAf few days later we met in person at UEB West and I felt good about our 'encounter'.\n\nAt the moment I am in a very exploitative phase of my life. \n\nI am not sure what I am going to contribute to OffCourse. \n\nAt the same time I am convinced that I will contribute. \n\nAlso I have a lot of personal things to sort out as well. \n\nI like to share photo's on Instagram.\n\n<https://www.instagram.com/stinie_>\n\nIn 2001 I started one of the first Instagram communities in the Netherlands and I had a lot of fun meeting nice people and exploring Rotterdam this way and I enjoyed collaborating with organization.\n\nIn 2015 I had to stop with being 'the mother' of the InstaWalk010 community and focus solely on myself due to personal reasons.\n\nBy the way I was a backend and frontend developer and I left my job in 2010. \n\nI don't know at the moment if I want to pick up my old profession or if I want to develop a different future or both....\n\nCurrently I only know that I want to keep exploring and by exploring my path will unfold itself to me (and others).\n\nThe first thing I want to contribute to OffCourse is my photography. \n\nI like to look at the world through a camera and that's why <@U0ARRNM3R> asked me if I want to document you guys in action.\n\nSo prepare yourself and get used to me and my camera visiting the 42Workspace office.\n\nBefore we publish any photo's you will be asked first Of(f) Course.\n\nNo publishing without permission.\n\nThat's about me.\n\nWhat and how about you.\n\nI am curious.\n\nSo if you like to introduce yourself as well.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nIf that is not your thing.\n\nFine as well.\n\nWe'll meet via a different path then.\n\nHave a good day,\n\nStinie \n\n\nA little professional history of mine\n<https://www.linkedin.com/in/stinie/> ","user":"U78C4L1FZ","ts":"1506338113.000073","team":"T0ARRBL8G","edited":{"user":"U78C4L1FZ","ts":"1506342142.000000"},"attachments":[{"fallback":"<https://twitter.com/yeehaa|@yeehaa>: <https://twitter.com/stinie|@stinie> <https://twitter.com/cevoostrum|@cevoostrum> <https://twitter.com/offcourse_|@offcourse_> <https://twitter.com/CityLab010|@CityLab010> :pray: mocht je het leuk vinden om mee te denken/praten, stuur me even een dm.

My feedback:\n- Youtube embedding doesn’t always work\n- Formatting of output is sometimes weird, e.g. <https://demo.offcourse.io/users/offcourse/courses/use-the-command-line/checkpoints/have-fun-with-cows>\n- Sign up/in doesn’t work. I get the pop up but i don’t actually get signed in.\n- I guess the font of the platform is designed for Chrome, because in Firefox and Safari the font is bold everywhere.\n- I'm getting a lot of 404 errors.\n- Sometimes I'm not getting anything; no text or 404 error, just a blank page with a title.
