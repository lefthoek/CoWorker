If filling is needed, use the tube called \"muurvulling\" (tip from a friend: I always use my fingers to apply it). For the holes and bits that have been filled, grab a piece of fine (not the rough) sandpaper and try to send down the restored part a bit to make it more blending with the wall and remove bigger bits. If already filled holes need more filling, do so. Once all that is done, make sure that all the high bits of the walls are cleaned (Natalie couldn't reach for those). After that. move on to the smaller room, Use fine sanding paper to sand down the loose flakes on the ceiling (you can already see bits that I have done).
