It would definitely help us with awareness creation and it would help us to “promote” the product during and in the aftermath of the hackathons to share knowledge. We should not take it as granted but a lot of “promo” work should be done during the hackathon. \nSecondly, I had a look at Sara’s document. It stands there that the workload from “our” side includes 40-50h in total (per event??). If that’s the time needed per event, I think we can handle it (with the help from all of us and Tamara – we have to agree with Mijke how many hours Tamara is available and set up a clear task division plan). \nWhat worries me is that we need to recruit sponsors on our own. As nobody of us has experience with recruiting sponsors, it’s going to cost us a lot of time. BUT if we could get help from Jinc with finding sponsors to cover the costs (venue, catering, extra voor Stichting Offcourse – from companies that share our ideology) we would be already half way. How many sponsors do we need to consider it a success?\nAnother thing is to figure out the challenges and/ or the theme of the event. We could do this by asking sponsors to create their own challenge or we can think about a theme and find challenges through this method. Working out challenges would cost us time though. \nFuther, finding hackers is up to us aswell. Maybe we could ask help for this from Mijke? Of in collaboration with Jinc? (for youth). Do we have our own network? How many hackers/ teams do we aim to consider it a successful event?\nAlso, we need to think about what can we offer to the sponsors and what are the prices for the hackers? As we haven’t organised any hackathon before, we need to scale our proposal high in order to attract sponsors and hackers (reputation, desire to participate). \nAll in all, I think we all agree that organising an hackathon is valuable for Offcourse. Before ee decide whether we can proceed NOW (in terms of human and financial capital) YES or NO, we should clear a couple of things:\n(1)\tWhether we can recruit sponsors via Jinc?! \n(2)\tWhether Sarah knows sponsors from America?\n(3)\tHow many hours per week/ project is Tamara available?\n(4)\tCan Optimus Acorro support us financially? (challenge organiser with “jobswitch” idea)\n(5)\tCan we recruit enough hackers/ teams via Jinc, Sara, own network, or other way?\nNB! See also hackathon idea from Mijke/ Tamara.
