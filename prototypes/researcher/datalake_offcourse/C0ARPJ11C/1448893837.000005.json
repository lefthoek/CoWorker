I have been traveling to Utrecht a lot helping to take care of my dad and I have to say that it is a lot for me. Unfortunately I can’t make today’s call again and I am sorry to say that I need a short sabbatical to help take care of my dad and will be staying in Utrecht for a longer period. I just don’t have the physical and mental time and space at the moment to be intensively involved . We know that me taking care of my dad is not a long term solution and we are actively thinking of other solutions, a nursing home not being one of them. I know you guys can manage as I haven’t been involved very actively and hope to be joining you guys very soon.
