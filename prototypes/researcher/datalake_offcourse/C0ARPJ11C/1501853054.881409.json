This one is more or less feature complete, except for the fact that I (for the moment) turned off saving to the back-end. Everything else that we set as target works now:\n- Progress Tracking\n- Course Creation\n- Edit Course\n- Authentication\n\nFor this version, I've chosen to roughly follow the forking and tracking flow that Pascal and Charlotte suggested last year. I must honestly say, that I am not entirely sure this works. Forking and tracking are now implicit actions, meaning that you start tracking your progress the moment you click a checkbox, and that you fork a course when you push edit.\n\nIn my opinion, this works for tracking, but not for forking. It's too implicit, meaning that the user does not realize what just happened. \n\nAnyways, I love to hear what your thoughts on this are. I definitely want to talk about this (and the feature roadmap) on our team day coming Tuesday. Hope you can all have a look at it before then. (<@U17C0L2VA> and <@U0ARRNM3R> in particular)\n\nAlso, I have created a new demo environment. This one is for <@U3MRJ1CDN> and <@U0ARRNM3R> in particular, to show to potential customers and partners. This environment, won't persist (save to the server) the courses that you create. That means, it's ideal to demonstrate features without 'littering' our production environment.\n\nA short overview and explanation of our environments:\n\n<http://nightly.offcourse.io|nightly.offcourse.io> - unstable, mainly for me (and hopefully other future devs) to deploy new features too.\n<http://edge.offcourse.io|edge.offcourse.io> - mostly stable. This environment is to test new features before we move them to the production environment\n<http://platform.offcourse.io|platform.offcourse.io> - stable, but currently inactive, the production environment. I expect too push this one live in two to three weeks\n<http://demo.offcourse.io|demo.offcourse.io> - stable, see explanation above\n\nAt the moment, the same version is deployed to all envs except platform.

Pricing&nbsp;starts at $2.50 per user per month on the lowest end, with a higher tier plan of $15 per user which includes video and screen-sharing among other features. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;a basic option available for free but that is limited to video calls and chat rooms between two users.\nChime is available for Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android devices.\nTechCrunch first reported that Amazon was planning this new service in November, when we wrote that the firm had acquired patents and staff from&nbsp;San Francisco-based Biba Systems, a startup behind video messaging apps aimed at business users.\nThe move is not only&nbsp;an alternative to communication services like Skype for business or Google Hangouts, but it is also takes AWS into the space of virtual meeting management, where companies like GoToMeeting and Cisco (WebEx) are the best known players.\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty hard to find people who actually like the technology they use for meetings today. Most meeting applications or services are hard to use, deliver bad audio and video, require constant switching between multiple tools to do everything they want, and are way too expensive,&rdquo; Gene Farrell, Vice President of enterprise applications at AWS, said in a statement.\nAWS is already a formidable player in cloud services, as TechCrunch enterprise reporter Ron Miller explained this week, but Chime pushes it into the services space to help strengthen its grip on customers as&nbsp;competition increases. Microsoft, Google and even new entrants like Alibaba are making big pushes to nab customers from AWS, which remains a key performer for Amazon financially.","fallback":"TechCrunch Link: Amazon launches Chime, a video conferencing and communications service for&nbsp;business","from_url":"http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIwz7inpTQ","service_icon":"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/favicon.ico","id":1}]},{"type":"message","text":"@amar OMG what? :slightly_smiling_face:","user":"U0ARRNM3R","ts":"1487102922.000004","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"'Nederland heeft 80.000 arbeidskrachten uit buitenland nodig'\n<http://nos.nl/l/2158167>","user":"U0D6EPESC","ts":"1487065446.000002","team":"T0ARRBL8G","attachments":[{"title":"'Nederland heeft 80.000 arbeidskrachten uit buitenland nodig'","title_link":"http://nos.nl/l/2158167","text":"Volgens uitzendconcern Randstad gaat het zo goed met de economie dat er grote tekorten dreigen.","fallback":"'Nederland heeft 80.000 arbeidskrachten uit buitenland nodig'","image_url":"https://nos.nl/data/image/2017/02/14/353451/xxl.jpg","image_width":444,"image_height":250,"from_url":"http://nos.nl/l/2158167","image_bytes":56300,"service_icon":"http://nos.nl/apple-touch-icon.png","service_name":"nos.nl","id":1}]},{"type":"message","text":"OMG","user":"U1F5WKXB8","ts":"1486994390.000006","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"<https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/finland-will-become-the-first-country-in-the-world-to-get-rid-of-all-school-subjects-259910>","user":"U0ARRNM3R","ts":"1486978821.000004","team":"T0ARRBL8G","attachments":[{"service_name":"BrightSide — Inspiration.
