I've cleared out the basic redundant information and organized the folders. But I don't have enough company knowledge to manage all the files on my own so the tasks are gonna be delegated based on each person's department.\n\n*Who and what?*\nEach person is delegated one folder on the Offcourse Google Drive folder to manage the file transfer.\n<@U177W7XH8> - Subsidies, Grants &amp; Applications\n<@U0D6EPESC> - Software Development\n<@UBE37B8JX> - MarCom\n<@U177W7XH8> - Finance\n<@U0D6EPESC> - Legal\n<@U9GR3G88Y> - Design\n<@U8AM0S37E> - Business Development\n\n*What you need to do?*\n1. Move redundant, irrelevant information to the folder 'Archive'. Only If you're certain that it can be deleted, go ahead and delete it.\n2. Create necessary sub-folders that you think you or the rest of your team will need.\n3.  Move all your documentation from Notion/Personal drives to the Offcourse Google Drive under their respective folders. It is VERY important to move your current work spaces/documents from your personal drives to the shared Offcourse one to ensure that we actually use the Drive folder when we work.\n\n*By when to do it?*\nTo make sure that all of us have our files transferred ASAP, it would be best if everyone who's been assigned a folder above can finish the final preparations on their folders for the file transfer by Monday, 19th November.\n\n*Link to Offcourse drive folder*\n<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0-pC7Pi8mtjNm8yRG5iRHplZVk>\n\nCheers! :raised_hands:","user":"UBNQTDJ7R","ts":"1542194814.023900","team":"T0ARRBL8G","reactions":[{"name":"white_check_mark","users":["U8AM0S37E"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"0b976315-3df7-4adf-ada0-523304a49202","type":"message","text":"Sure <@U0D6EPESC> So cool the new version is already at <http://offcourse.io|offcourse.io>.
