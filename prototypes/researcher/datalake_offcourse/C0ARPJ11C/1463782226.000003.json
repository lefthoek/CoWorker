Everything feels a bit out of place and the iconography isn’t immediately clear. More specifically I noticed these things:\n\n1. The task list is in a weird place. It’s intuitively the main thing of a goal and yet it’s hidden at the bottom.\n2. Hierarchy is a problem. In the goal and task view the actual goal or task has less visual space and weight than the collaborative features. It should be more equal.\n3. WIP—submit and goal discussion seem overlapping features somehow.  I’d opt for the latter, incase multiple people encounter the same problem. \n4. The graph feels pushy, not constructive and a big temptation to exploit. Being S.M.A.R.T. is cool to get started and get stuff done, but learning isn’t this measurable in the end. The app shouldn’t give the illusion that it is. \n\nOne more small thing: The user modal shouldn’t link do dashboard but just disappear.","user":"U0HU55QSD","ts":"1452628611.000007","team":"T0ARRBL8G","edited":{"user":"U0HU55QSD","ts":"1452628627.000000"}},{"type":"message","text":"ah, yes, forgot about that.
