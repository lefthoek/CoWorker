We did notice however that levels and points are meaningless by themselves and those we’re heavily present in the current reward document. To stay in the racing game metaphor: you care about faster cars or new tracks/levels and you care about the thing you have to do to get there, win races, or cross checkpoints to get additional time. \n\nFor developers that last part is clear: code features. The tags are a nice hinge there: they can determine value. It became apparent that there are still quite a bit of ambiguities in the tags that should be cleared up. For instance the autonomy tag is almost a paradox: high autonomy towards people makes the developer more valuable to us. But a highly autonomous feature, in the isolated sense, is not necessarily more valuable. We remained in a struggle with the rewards though, they are hard to clarify/legitimize, although we did spread out the levels of social inclusion more equally.\n\nAs for actionables: Sander has some leads on how to improve the document and make it more outwards facing. For me there there are the ambiguities, but my main course of action for the docs will be determined Friday as we structure the entire documentation.","user":"U0HU55QSD","ts":"1470917557.000009","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"To make it a bit more clear I wrote up a bit of stuff from the call yesterday out of the back of my head just now:","user":"U0HU55QSD","ts":"1470917555.000008","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"<@U0ARRNM3R>: i'm implementing them in the new reward struture document","user":"U177W7XH8","ts":"1470916214.000007","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"<@U0HU55QSD>: <@U177W7XH8> ^^","user":"U0ARRNM3R","ts":"1470915649.000005","team":"T0ARRBL8G","edited":{"user":"U0ARRNM3R","ts":"1470915657.000000"}},{"type":"message","text":"Have you decided on next actions?","user":"U0ARRNM3R","ts":"1470915641.000004","team":"T0ARRBL8G"},{"type":"message","text":"<@U0ARRNM3R> Sander and I talked yesterday evening about it; but we focussed on the places the two are/could be connected, not so much the internal structure of the documents, although that did pass by a bit.
